# Brine v1 contracts

**Status: Approved design target, not an implemented API.** See [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md) for where state lives, transport, Caddy, secrets and ports. The initial CLI still only exposes `version`, `doctor`, and the placeholder `tui`. Stabilize these contracts with tests before claiming compatibility.

## Command surface

~~~text
brine init [directory]
brine validate ./brine.toml
brine plan ./brine.toml --target staging
brine apply PLAN_ID --target staging
brine status --target staging
brine status --operation OPERATION_ID --target staging
brine logs APP --target staging --tail 100
brine rollback APP --release RELEASE_ID --target staging
brine backup status APP --target staging
brine restore test APP --target staging
brine tui --target staging

Plan is read-only with respect to runtime/proxy/data; it stores the plan in the target's control database (D1). `plan --offline` compares to a supplied snapshot and yields a **non-applyable** preview. Applying always refers to a recorded immutable plan and revalidates target identity, policy, observed generation, and artifact hashes. Rollback creates a **plan**, not an implicit mutation. Avoid an automatic `destroy` command.

Machine modes: `--no-input`, `--json` for one response object, and later `--jsonl` for an event stream. JSON and JSONL cannot be combined. Output must never include ANSI codes, spinners, prompts or raw subprocess blobs. Diagnostics go to stderr. Stable error envelope: `schema_version`, `command`, `ok`, `data`, `error` (with machine code, safe message, retryable). A response that accepts a background operation says **accepted**, not **deployed**. Ctrl-C disconnects the observer, not the server-side operation.

Proposed exit categories: 0 success or accepted; 1 internal/operational failure; 2 validation/usage; 3 incompatible/missing dependency; 4 refused by policy; 5 stale plan/lock conflict; 6 manual recovery required; 130 interrupted client. These are to be formally tested in phase 00.

## App definition

Strict versioned `brine.toml` for one trusted OCI web app. Unknown fields fail, app names/domains are canonicalized and validated, environment keys are checked, and image references must contain a digest. Disallow free-form Quadlet snippets, arbitrary shell hooks, host path mounts, raw proxy JSON, arbitrary Podman flags, and target endpoint injection.

**Illustrative, not runnable** until the placeholder digest is replaced with a real digest from a fixture image:

~~~toml
schema_version = 1
name = "hello"
image = "ghcr.io/example/hello@sha256:<64-hex-digest>"
container_port = 3000
domains = ["hello.example.com"]

[health]
path = "/healthz"
expected_status = 200
startup_deadline_seconds = 30
timeout_seconds = 3

[resources]
memory_mb = 256
pids_limit = 128

[environment]
APP_ENV = "production"

[secrets]
SESSION_KEY = "hello-session-key"  # Podman secret name, never a value
~~~

Secrets are **references** to Podman secrets owned by the runner user on the target (D5); never render secret values into plan output or git. Target policy controls allowed registries, domains, ports, secret IDs, persistence roots and public exposure. Resource settings are enforced by the adapter rather than blindly passed through.

## Plan and durable state

A plan binds desired spec hash, target identity, observed generation, image digest and platform, policy version, secret-reference versions, artifact digests, expiry and change summary. Identical canonical inputs should generate identical hashes; timestamps live outside hash material. Plan acceptance is not a general authorization grant.

Use a small SQLite control database **on the target**, owned by the runner user, for plans, releases, operations and append-only ordered events (D1). Clients keep only target configuration. It is **separate** from app SQLite databases and needs its own recovery story. Use a bounded connection pool, transactions around local state only, and migrations. Choose a maintained SQLite Go driver in a deliberate dependency PR.

A deployment writes intent and operation state durably *before* changing files, Quadlet units, containers or proxy routes. Each tool boundary has a typed adapter with bounded outputs and timeouts. Acquire a per-host lock **before** checking plan freshness; one mutation per target. Reconcile observed state after crashes: neither subprocess exit status nor client timeout alone proves an external change succeeded or failed.

## Release behavior

For MVP accept brief interruption: pull/verify a new image, stage immutable release/unit material, announce maintenance, ensure old writer stopped, activate new release, start service, check direct and routed health, publish route, record success. Maintain previous known-good immutable artifacts. If safe, restore previous app release on failure; if migrations or data compatibility make rollback uncertain, stop and mark `recovery_required`.

Use state labels such as `queued`, `preflight`, `preparing`, `quiescing`, `starting`, `checking`, `committing`, `rolling_back`, `succeeded`, `failed`, `rolled_back`, and `recovery_required`. Persist ordered events with monotonically increasing per-operation sequence IDs. Do not perform network or host operations inside a long SQLite database transaction.

**App rollback never rewinds SQLite.** v1 does not perform uncontrolled startup migrations or auto-restore databases. Background/worker overlap is not supported yet.

## Runtime ownership and authorization

Enroll each host with affirmative operator action and a read-only inventory. Refuse conflicts with existing software, ports, domains and volumes; do not uninstall Coolify because a plan mentions a proxy (the owner removes it manually, D4). Use a dedicated rootless Podman service user and systemd user units. Test Quadlet install/reboot semantics on the pinned distribution, not merely against a local mock.

Caddy is the host's packaged service. Brine owns only `/etc/caddy/brine.d/*.caddy`, validates the full config before each change, reloads through a polkit-scoped `systemctl reload caddy.service`, serializes changes, detects drift by hash, and preserves all unrelated site configuration (D4). Apps never reach the admin API.

Rootless does **not** mean safe for an untrusted agent. A deployment identity that can SSH freely and control Podman can bypass Brine checks and can alter its own app data. Autonomous production mode requires an operator-owned policy and the restricted dispatcher (`brine host serve` as a forced SSH command, D1), whose permissions exclude root, host deletion, raw Podman/Caddy control and cloud teardown.

## Database and recovery

SQLite data, WAL and related files live in durable per-app directories independent of release images. Run **one independent Litestream replicator per database/destination** (matching a tested Litestream release), with separately scoped R2 credentials and destination paths. Replication is asynchronous and may lose recent writes when the VPS dies. Do not start competing replicas writing the same destination.

`restore test` writes into a new isolated directory or disposable fixture, checks `PRAGMA integrity_check`, verifies expected application invariants and reports recovery-point information if available. It **never overwrites the production DB**. Live restore stays an explicitly approved operator runbook. Database storage or backup deletion is never part of image cleanup.
